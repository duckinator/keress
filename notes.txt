- episode based
- 4 episodes - 3 gradual buildup, then boss
- 3 levels per episode
- dynamic level design (level responds to player)
- enemy difficulty gradient goes
- multiple weapons designed to follow the same difficulty gradient as the game itself.
- control which weapons are used based on where ammo pickups are.

first enemy:
- charges/teleports in a pattern (square or triangle maybe?) around the player three times in quick succession, then pauses; repeat
- focuses on avoiding taking damage and herding the player into dangerous areas. perhaps can't even do damage at all?
- takes more damage during the pauses

second enemy:
- attack, move; attack, move; attack, move; attack, attack, attack?
- focuses on attrition - steady stream of slow, weak attacks from many directions

third enemy:
- moves quickly around the player in three movements, then throws the player at things to injure them
- similar to the first enemy, but noticably distinct

forth enemy:
- breaks the pattern: doesn't follow a-a-a-b attack style
- far less predictable, but not purely random behavior -- a wide range of attacks, dodges, and movement (maybe even climbing things), but applied in a sensible manner
